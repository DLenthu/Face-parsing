# Face-parsing

Performed face parsing using pix2pix GAN

Dataset used : FAce Semantic SEGmentation (FASSEG)

Applications : Can be used to isolate various parts of the face

Example : can be used to isolate the hair to change the hair color

We can use the same setup to reconstruct real human faces from segmented labels.
This can be done by swapping labels{now as the input} and input images{now as the taget}.
